Survival simulation "games" - blobs and mating for now.

Just some random blobs with random movement, random rotation:

This one is more interesting.

* Red = Female / Blue = Male (obviously)
* Each blob can move randomly about
* Blobs age and die at age 101
* Each male/female meeting can result in conception if
** Both parties are of age (20)
** The female is not already pregnant
** The product of their fertility is higher than a random value
* The more transparent the less fertile
* Females get 10% less fertile after each pregnancy
* Offspring are small and grow until age 20
